I am a third-year Statistics PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu) at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) advised by [Kevin Jamieson](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/about.html) from the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). I am also a part-time Applied Scientist Intern at the [SCOT - Forecasting Science Department](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) of Amazon. Before that, I completed my BA in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and BA in [Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), graduating *Summa cum laude*. At Berkeley, I had the privilege of working with [Anil Aswani](https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/), [Cyrus Dioun](https://business.ucdenver.edu/about/our-people/cyrus-dioun), and [Haichen Wang](https://hwang43.web.cern.ch/), focusing on the application of optimization and deep learning models in sociology, particle physics, and tensor completion.

<!-- My research interests span machine learning and mathematical optimization. I am deeply interested in developing methodologies and models that offer practical applications while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees. Lately, I have been particularly drawn to adaptive, online, data-driven decision-making and learning algorithms with feedback loops. I am working on bandit algorithms for matrix completion problemsto enhance the robustness and efficiency of recommender systems with [Kevin Jamieson](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/about.html). -->

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and mathematical optimization, **with a particular focus on decision-making, sampling, and prediction problems involving sequential data**. My theoretical research, advised by Kevin Jamieson, centers on **developing matrix completion bandit algorithms for collaborative filtering to enhance recommender systems**. A key aspect of this work is establishing entry-specific error bounds under arbitrary non-uniform sampling distributions. On the applied side, my work as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon focuses on **improving foundation models for time series forecasting**, specifically by integrating classical statistical models to boost their zero-shot prediction capabilities.
