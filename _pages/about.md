I am a second-year PhD student in Statistics at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). Before that, I completed my BA in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and BA in [Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), graduating *Summa cum laude*. At Berkeley, I had the privilege of working with [Anil Aswani](https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/), [Cyrus Dioun](https://business.ucdenver.edu/about/our-people/cyrus-dioun), and [Haichen Wang](https://hwang43.web.cern.ch/), focusing on the application of optimization and deep learning models in sociology, particle physics, and tensor completion.

My research interests span statistical machine learning and optimization. I am deeply interested in developing methodologies and models that offer practical applications while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees. Lately, I have been particularly drawn to adaptive, online, data-driven decision-making and learning algorithms with feedback loops. I am working on bandit algorithms for matrix completion problemsto enhance the robustness and efficiency of recommender systems with [Kevin Jamieson](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/about.html).

My protrait on the right was taken by my good friend [Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/li-tian-cal/) at [Lake Tapps Park](https://www.piercecountywa.gov/1326/North-Lake-Tapps-Park) in Bonney Lake, WA.
